## Reporting a Vulnerability

The LQG Polymer Field Generator implements advanced quantum field manipulation technologies. Due to the sensitive nature of spacetime engineering research, we take security concerns seriously.

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@asciimath.org](mailto:security@asciimath.org)
2. **Include**: 
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested mitigation if known

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution Timeline**: Varies based on severity (1-4 weeks typical)
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is deployed

### Security Considerations

This repository contains:
- Quantum field theory implementations
- Spacetime engineering algorithms
- Advanced mathematical frameworks
- Production-ready optimization systems

**Note**: This is theoretical research code. No actual spacetime manipulation capabilities are implemented. All algorithms are mathematical models for academic and research purposes.

### UQ (Uncertainty Quantification) Security

The comprehensive UQ framework includes:
- Parameter validation with secure bounds checking
- Robust optimization preventing convergence failures
- Numerical stability protections against edge cases
- Error propagation validation throughout the enhancement chain

**UQ Status**: HIGH (all critical security-related concerns resolved)

### Safe Usage Guidelines

1. **Parameter Validation**: Always use the RobustParameterValidator
2. **Bounds Checking**: Ensure parameters remain within validated ranges
3. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error catching around optimization routines
4. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate computational resource limits for optimization
5. **Validation**: Run UQ analysis before production deployment
